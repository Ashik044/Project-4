# TravelThrive

This is a website that I built using raw HTML, CSS, and Sass, as well as Vanilla JavaScript. I did not use any JavaScript UI libraries like React JS, Angular JS, or Next JS. These projects helped me gain a better understanding of how to build a website from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
